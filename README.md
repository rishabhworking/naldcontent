NaldCoin
If you want to mine coins without the hassle of managing your own hardware, there is an alternative. You can use the cloud to mine your coins.
Simply put, cloud mining means using the shared processing power that runs from remote data centres. Only one home computer is needed for communications.
Today we are going to talk about the coin which you may use for the cloud mining.
Naldcoin is a cloud mining platform for creating coins and sending to each other.
 So, How Naldcoin works?
Naldcoin can only be mined in the cloud. Firstly, the user has to lease the amount of coins for some time. Every day, the leased coins will be transferred into the user’s Naldcoin wallet until their contract expires. For the mining purposes, the user will get their server for the required period of time. 
So, Why Naldcoin?
With Naldcoin, you only have to choose and buy the plan from our website that you will receive in your wallet every day. So you don’t have to spend more money on mining equipment and after that you start mining with the proper electricity 24/7.
The main objective of Naldcoin is to have fun and ejection in the crypto world. This coin will not only stick with fun but also explore all the options that cryptocurrencies offer.
Naldcoin is environmentally friendly because it will not take a lot of electricity to mine it.
A limited number of coins’ will be available for lease. Number of Naldcoins are limited to a supply of NALD 21,000,000,000. The mining process will be completed when the last coin is delivered to the user’s wallet. No more Naldcoin will be minted, so there is no mining. Naldcoin tokens act as platform for people to create their own coin and send it to each other and have fun. All transactions on the Naldcoin platform are tokenized using ND, which is placed in cold storage after being used on the network.
You can play Video Games, DApp Games and eSports and get free rewards. The main purpose of our coin is to have fun in blockchain based plateform.
Join us and have fun with us and play game with us.
What NALDCOIN offers?
Once you have created your coin for fun, coins can be made unique for a cost of 5 NALD. Only non-divisible assets can be made unique. This moves an asset to a UTXO and associates a unique identifier with the txID. From this point the asset can be moved from one address to another and can be traced back to its origin. Only the issuer of the original asset can make an asset unique.
The costs to make unique assets will be sent to a burn address.
Some examples of unique assets:

Imagine that an art dealer issues the asset named ART. The dealer can then make unique ART assets by attaching a name or a serialized number to each piece of art. 
These unique tokens can be transferred to the new owner along with the artwork as a proof of authenticity. The tokens ART: MonaLisa and ART: VenusDeMilo are not fungible and represent distinct pieces of art.
Another example of unique assert is like if a software developer can issue the asset with the name of their software ABCGAME, and then assign each ABCGAME token a unique id or license key. The game tokens could be transferred as the license transfers. Each token ABCGAME:398222 and ABCGAME: are unique tokens.
In game assets. A game ZYX_GAME could create unique limited edition in-game assets that are owned and used by the game player. Example: ZYX_GAME: Sword005 and ZYX_GAME: Purse
NALD based unique assets can be tied to real world assets. Create an asset named GOLDVAULT. Each gold coin or gold bar in a vault can be serialized and audited. Associated unique assets GOLDVAULT: 444322 and GOLDVAULT: 555994 can be created to represent the specific assets in the physical gold vault. The public nature of the chain allows for full transparency.
Delegative or Liquid voting
Vote tokens move just like regular tokens up until the block height when the vote expires. This allows vote token holders to send their vote to a delegate that might have better information about the topic and therefore cast a more informed vote.
Naldcoin voting supports this type of vote while still protecting against counterfeit votes and ensuring votes can't be cast twice, and transparently tracking every vote that is cast or not cast.
Asset Support
Naldcoin will be a hard fork that extends Naldcoin to include the ability to issue and transfer assets. The expected release of asset capabilities will be approximately seven months after the release of NALD. Naldcoin will be extended to allow issuing, reissuing, and transfer of assets. Assets can be re issuable or limited to a set supply at the point of issuance. The cost to create assets will be 500 NALD to create any quantity of an asset. 
Each asset name must be unique. Asset names will be limited to A-Z and 0-9, '' and '.' and must be at least three characters long. The '.' and the '' cannot be the first, or the last character, or be consecutive.
Examples of valid assets:
THE_GAME
A.TOKEN
123
Examples of invalid assets:

_TOKEN
THEEND.
A..B (consecutive punctuation)
AB
12
.FIRST apple
The NALD coin will be used to issue assets which will be sent to a burn address, which will reduce the amount of NALD available.
Asset transfers require the standard NALD transaction fees for transfer from one address to another.
Why Cloud Mining?
However, there are certain risks associated with cloud mining that users need to understand prior to purchase.
Pros
1. Here’s why you might want to consider cloud mining:
2. A quiet, cooler home – no constantly humming fans
3. No added electricity costs
4. No equipment to sell when mining ceases to be profitable
5. No ventilation problems with hot equipment
6. Reduced chance of being let down by mining equipment suppliers.
Cons
Here’s why you might not want to consider cloud mining:
1. Risk of fraud
2. Opaque mining operations
3. Less fun (if you’re a geek who likes system building!)
4. Lower profits – the operators have to cover their costs after all
5. Contractual warnings that mining operations may cease depending on the price of bitcoin
6. Lack of control and flexibility.
Types of cloud mining
In general, there are three forms of remote mining available at the moment:
1. Hosted mining
2. Lease a mining machine that is hosted by the provider.
3. Virtual hosted mining
Create a (general purpose) virtual private server and install your own mining software.
Leased hashing power
Lease an amount of hashing power, without having a dedicated physical or virtual computer. (This is, by far, the most popular method of cloud mining.)

HOSTED MINING VS. CLOUD MINING: A COMPARISON
As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to grow, more and more opportunities to capitalize on these technologies are presenting themselves. One major way in which consumers and businesses alike are profiting from the surge in cryptocurrency is via mining. Yet, cryptocurrency mining is extremely complex, and requires knowledge of decentralized protocols and the correct equipment in order to succeed. For this reason, the services of cloud and hosted mining solutions are beginning to emerge as legitimate ways to mine Bitcoin with the help of third-party solutions.
MINING: WHAT TO KNOW TO GET INVOLVED
Cryptocurrency mining requires securing a blockchain network by completing complex algorithms, known as proof-of-work (PoW) mining. Because these equations are so complex, it takes a significant amount of computing power to solve them, and in turn, receive new cryptocurrency as a reward for doing so. This makes the most important aspect of mining hashing power, or, the rate at which a piece of equipment can solve these complex algorithms.
As blockchain networks grow, so do their hash rates, making it more difficult and resource intensive to successfully mine new coins. For example, the current Bitcoin hash rate is above 50 million tera hashes per second, up almost tenfold from just a year ago. This makes it more difficult to do the necessary work required for securing a block on the Bitcoin blockchain. For this reason, having access to as much hashing power as possible, while being the most energy efficient, is the key to mining profitability.
HOSTED MINING
Hosted mining allows a provider to build and lease/sell mining equipment directly to a customer. This model can play out in a number of ways, but generally involves a customer purchasing mining equipment from a hosted service, or purchasing equipment on their own and having it sent directly to a hosted data center or mining farm. The customer then pays for electricity and storage costs associated with hosting. This allows someone to mine a blockchain with purchased equipment without having to deal with the storage, electricity, and maintenance concerns of running mining hardware on their own.
Hosted mining provides more control on the part of the purchaser, as they have access to the exact specifications and output of their mining equipment, and can have remote access into their mining hardware to monitor exactly how it is performing. Additionally, because each customer owns their mining equipment, cryptocurrency never has to be touched by the hosted service, lessening the security risk between the miner and a third-party service.
Yet, customers of hosted mining services have a relatively high upfront cost via the purchasing of mining hardware. This doesn’t include the costs associated with repairing mining equipment over time which can add up.
CLOUD MINING
Cloud mining allows customers to pool processing power together in order to mine cryptocurrency on a mass, and cheaper scale. Because there is no cost for purchasing mining equipment, it is relatively cheap to get started on a cloud mining services, where customers generally pay for the electricity consumption and fees associated with mining, as well as a percentage of the block reward for cloud mining services.
Anyone who is cloud mining should ensure the service they are utilizing can guarantee the hash rate and mining capabilities they are specifying, as fraud and false advertising is rampant in the cloud mining industry. Security is also key here, as cloud-based mining services collect mined coins and distribute them to customers
How to determine profitability
We have previously covered ways to calculate mining profitability. However, the web services offered are designed to work with your hardware parameters, not cloud-mining parameters.
Even so, you can still use these calculators by thinking clearly about the costs involved. Profitability calculators (for example, The Genesis Block) often ask for your electricity costs, and sometimes the initial investment in hardware. Effectively, you are being asked for your ongoing costs and your one-off investments.
Therefore, since the provider, not you, is paying the electricity bills, you can enter the monthly mining bill in place of the electricity cost.
The conversion process isn’t completely straightforward, though. In the case of hardware miners, you can work out the monthly running cost by multiplying your electricity charge (ie: $ per KWh) by the power consumption of the unit and by a conversion factor of 0.744 (the ratio of seconds per month to joules of energy per KWh).
But, for cloud mining calculations, you need to do the opposite, because the provider gives you an (effective) monthly running cost. Hence, you need to calculate an equivalent cost per kilowatt hour to feed into the mining calculator. This is done by dividing (not multiplying) the monthly running cost by the 0.744 conversion factor mentioned above.
Risk vs Reward
When engaging in any type of cryptocurrency mining there are risks, but profitability is possible if you make the right choices. In this article, we’ve given you some pointers on how to decide which way to go.
In your test calculations, you will likely see that some cloud mining services will be profitable for a few months, but, as the difficulty level of bitcoin increases, you would probably start to make a loss in four to six months and beyond.
A possible remedy to this situation is to reinvest what you have made into maintaining a competitive hashing rate, but this is highly speculative.
As mentioned above, the risk of fraud and mismanagement is all too common in the cloud mining space. Users should only invest in cloud mining if they are comfortable with these risks – as the saying goes, never invest more than you are willing to lose.
Is Cloud Mining Profitable?
It depends what your goals are with cloud mining. If your goal is to obtain bitcoins, then there is really no reason to cloud mine or even mine at all.
You will get more bitcoins for your buck if you just buy bitcoins!
If you think mining is cool and want to try, then cloud mining still is not a good option. Grab a cheap USB miner and run it at home.
Anyone looking to begin mining, be it with a hosted or cloud-based solution, should make sure to do the proper research before getting involved. This means understanding the hashing power, energy usage, and monthly hosting fees associated with mining. Some blockchains offer calculators to better understand the cost of mining and how much profit to expect based on the network hash rate and other variables.
A proper mining solution should be transparent in their payment method, contract, fees, energy usage, and more.
